# Neural Networks from Scratch

A comprehensive 6-semester journey through building neural networks from scratch in Python.

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of neural network components built entirely from scratch, using only NumPy for numerical operations. No high-level ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) are used.

## Structure
- `semester1/` - Foundations & Basic Neural Networks
- `semester2/` - Deep Neural Networks & Optimization
- `semester3/` - Convolutional Neural Networks
- `semester4/` - Advanced CNNs & Training
- `semester5/` - Recurrent Neural Networks
- `semester6/` - Attention & Transformers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-Rahmane/nn-from-scratch.git
cd nn-from-scratch
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Running Tests
```bash
pytest semester1/lab1_tensor_operations/tests/
```
